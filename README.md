# Maldozer Re-implementation

This repository contains our re-implementation of **MalDozer** (*MalDozer: Automatic framework for android malware detection using deep learning*, Digital Investigation 2018). The official implementation of MalDozer has some issues that prevent it from generating the expected results.

If you use this version in your project, please cite our paper:
